# LoginPortal
 LogIn portal

Welcome to the early beta release of my projectâ€”a secure login portal emphasizing password security for workers. This initial version sets the foundation for managing worker profiles and ensuring robust authentication practices.

Key Features:
Username and Password Validation: Utilizes stringent validation criteria to ensure strong password policies.
Manager Control: Allows managers to oversee and edit worker profiles, ensuring operational efficiency.
Default Manager Setup: Includes a default manager profile for initial setup and management.
Future Updates: Look forward to upcoming releases that will introduce advanced features like file encryption using asymmetric encryption techniques. This will bolster project security by safeguarding shared files within the workplace.

I appreciate your interest and feedback as we continue to enhance and expand this project.

## Instructions

When first starting off this program I created a default manager login. This is meant as a first time manager to sign in, create their account and delete the default manager.

Credentials for default manager are as follows (this can be changed yourself by editing the code):
Username: OpeningMana!ger5634
Password: sDasvf43#DSa32

In order for new workers to sign up they require a special key, this can only be created by the manager. Once a key is used it is stored in the used_key dictionary and cannot be used again.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository.

git clone https://github.com/KeanuGhal/LoginPortal/blob/main/LogInScreen

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

cd your-repository

3. Run the Program:
Execute your program.

## Usage

Program Usage
This program serves as an early beta version of a secure login portal designed for managing worker profiles with enhanced password security measures. It emphasizes the importance of strong password practices among employees. Currently, the program allows for:

New Sign-In: Enables new employees to register with validated usernames and secure passwords.
Existing User Sign-In: Allows registered employees to log in securely using their credentials.
Manager Sign-In: Grants managers access to administrative functions such as managing worker profiles.
Manager Features: Includes functionalities for creating new manager profiles, editing worker profiles, listing current workers, and removing workers.
Future updates aim to implement file encryption using asymmetric encryption techniques, further enhancing project security within the workplace.
